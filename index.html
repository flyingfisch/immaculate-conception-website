        <h2>Note to Newcomers</h2>

        <p>
            Welcome to Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic Church.
            The clergy and parishioners of Immaculate Conception adhere firmly 
            to the unchangeable Catholic Faith as taught by all true Popes,
            from St. Peter to Pope Pius XII. Because of our faithfulness to the 
            Catholic Church of the ages, we reject the Modernist church of Vatican II 
            with all its teachings, liturgical rites, and disciplines. We reject John XXIII,
            Paul VI, John Paul I, John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Francis as illegitimate 
            usurpers of the papal office and believe that there is currently no Pope 
            reigning in the Catholic Church (sede vacante).  Please see the 
            <a href="http://www.cmri.org/why-we-believe-the-chair-of-peter-is-vacant.shtml">Theological Position of the CMRI</a>
            for an understanding of the present crisis in the Church,
            and how we can preserve the true Catholic Faith in these troubling times.    
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>We gladly welcome visitors and newcomers.</strong>

            At the same time, we respectfully remind them that to receive our Lord in Holy Communion, one must be:

            <ul>
                <li>A baptized Catholic free from any mortal sin committed since one’s last Confession</li>
                <li>Fasting for three hours from any food and/or alcoholic beverage</li>
                <li>One hour from any other beverage except water </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Out of respect for the True Presence of Our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament,
            and for the edification of our neighbor, we kindly request that all who 
            come to our parish observe the basic traditional Catholic standards of 
            dress for church attendance:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Women and girls must cover their heads. (Chapel veils or mantillas are available for loan in the vestibule.)</li>
            <li>
                Women and girls must wear dresses or skirts that cover the knee completely when standing or sitting.
                Slacks, shorts, sleeveless, tight or low-cut clothing, and dresses or skirts with long slits above the knees are not permitted.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is recommended for men and boys to wear suit coats and ties for Sunday Mass. Jeans and other casual attire are 
                inappropriate for attendance at church.
            </li>
        </ul>
